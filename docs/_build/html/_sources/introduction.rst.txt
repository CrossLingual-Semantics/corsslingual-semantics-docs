### Overview of the CrossLingual Alignment Collaboration

The **CrossLingual Alignment Collaboration** aims to explore and analyze **semantic relationships between words across languages** using **Small World of Words (SWOW)** data. Our goal is to improve **cross-lingual semantic equivalence** through structured **word associations** instead of relying solely on pretrained models.

This collaboration is structured into three key phases:

1. **Building the Pipeline**  
   - Utilizing **SWOW data** to extract cross-lingual word associations.
   - Defining **semantic similarity** based on associations instead of direct embeddings.

2. **Developing a Web Interface**  
   - Creating a **Plotly-based dashboard** that integrates into a **university CMS (Squiz Matrix)**.
   - Ensuring **intuitive visualization of word associations**.

3. **Research & Publication**  
   - Documenting the methodology and **enhanced SWOW dataset**.
   - Comparing **association-based embeddings** with traditional word embeddings.
   - Publishing findings in NLP & linguistics conferences.

This initiative prioritizes **interpretability**, ensuring **cross-lingual comparisons remain transparent and explainable**. By integrating **BabelNet**, we enhance the dataset with linguistic dimensions, including:
- **Parts of Speech (POS)**
- **Lexical relations**
- **Sense mapping for better alignment**.

In the next section, we discuss how we **enhance SWOW for better multilingual comparison**.
